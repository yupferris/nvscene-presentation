..just some notes:

 - Recall Gavin Strange's presentation from fitc. Consider putting the presentation together in a very designer-ish way, with vibrant colors, videos (gifs), etc in the presentation.

 - Take Bent's advice: Yes, get into the tech details; no, that's not the main focus. The main focus is the problem-solving side of things - inspire people to look at things differently, try new things, and take new perspectives.

 - Remember that this is a good opportunity to show YOU and what YOU're all about, not just one thing you did. Brand yourself with being awesome rather than the project in the talk. RADNESS.

 - Use Reveal.js (http://slides.com/) for the actual slides, possible through https://github.com/fsprojects/FsReveal

 - Take inspiration also from the following talks:
