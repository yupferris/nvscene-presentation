## Outline
 - Chronological order of events:
   - Tried SNES dev at 17, couldn't do it
   - Did some C64 stuff, that was better
   - Kickassembler
   - Tried Atari VCS, music sucked
   - Laptop stolen, tried Gameboy dev
   - Kickassembler too slow, custom assembler
   - Demon Blood
   - Revamped assembler
   - SNES tracker
   - Nu
     - Cramped for time
     - Video
     - Typical demo workflow (GL, rocket)
     - Elix was born
   - Got bit by the functional bug
   - Smash It

## Notes

 - Recall Gavin Strange's presentation from fitc. Consider putting the presentation together in a very designer-ish way, with vibrant colors, videos (gifs), etc in the presentation.

 - Take Bent's advice: Yes, get into the tech details; no, that's not the main focus. The main focus is the problem-solving side of things - inspire people to look at things differently, try new things, and take new perspectives.

 - Remember that this is a good opportunity to show YOU and what YOU're all about, not just one thing you did. Brand yourself with being awesome rather than the project in the talk. RADNESS.

 - Use Reveal.js (http://slides.com/) for the actual slides, possibly through https://github.com/fsprojects/FsReveal

 - Take inspiration also from the following talks:

## Original talk description

Ever wanted to make something that looks and sounds awesome with a gaming console you've played on your entire life? Ever wanted to build a proper, modern toolset to do so and experiment with functional programming at the same time? Then this talk is for you!

We'll take a look at two recent Super Nintendo demos, and, in particular, the ideas and methodologies applied when making them. First, we'll go over some of the details of the SNES' quirky hardware and the usual methods of making it tick. Building from there, we'll look at how most of this can be reduced to "simple" data processing, and how modern development techniques can be applied to make this simpler and more interesting.

All in all, this talk aims to show how applicable modern programming practices can be to unexpected problem domains, and how inspiring it can be to work with creative, out-of-the-box solutions. After all, a little ancient console dev never hurt anyone, right?
